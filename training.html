    <!-- Chosen Palette: Earthy Trail Palette (Slate/Deep Blue #374151, Muted Orange/Ochre #f59e0b, Off-White Background #f9fafb) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA uses a single-page Dashboard approach. Key components include: 1. A global Week Selector dropdown (Sidebar). 2. A Summary Metrics section showing aggregated data (Total Hours, Quality Time, Rest Days) for the selected week. 3. A Trend Visualization area (Chart.js) showing the progression of volume across all 10 weeks. 4. A Detailed Schedule Table presenting the daily workout plan for the selected week. This structure was chosen because the source report is sequential and time-based; the dashboard allows users to jump instantly to any week (non-linear access) while maintaining context of the overall linear progression (via the chart). This provides optimal ease of exploration and synthesis. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Summary Metrics (Report Info: Weekly Aggregates -> Goal: Quick assessment -> Viz/Presentation Method: Stat Cards (HTML/CSS/Tailwind) -> Interaction: Dynamic update on week change -> Justification: High-visibility KPIs -> Library/Method: HTML/JS). Weekly Progression (Report Info: Volume/Intensity across 10 weeks -> Goal: Show peaking/tapering trend -> Viz/Presentation Method: Combo Bar/Line Chart (Chart.js) -> Interaction: Highlight selected week -> Justification: Visualizes the crucial training load changes -> Library/Method: Chart.js/Canvas). Daily Schedule (Report Info: Daily Workout Details -> Goal: Specific task list -> Viz/Presentation Method: HTML Table -> Interaction: Dynamic update on week change -> Justification: Clearest way to present matrix data -> Library/Method: HTML/JS). CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
